    title: Resume Template Kit
    description: I wasn't satisfied with most word based Resume templates, and
      services like Adobe and Canva are often challenging to customize and are
      not ATS friendly. So I wrote my own resume by using the LaTeX scripting
      language, and built a tool for myself to host the PDF version and manage
      it's content over time.

      - Tailwind
      - DrizzleORM
      - Postgres
