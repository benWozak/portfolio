  My journey as a **Software Developer** started in 2016 when I decided to leave
  my career in the culinary industry to pursue something more in-line with my
  values and engage with my desire to solve complex problems and contribute
  something meaningful to the world. This led me to [The Southern Alberta
  Institute of Technology](https://www.sait.ca/) where I discovered a passion
  for front-end development. 


  Iï»¿ was hired immediately out graduation and have been working ever since. I'm currently employed at [chata.ai](https://chata.ai/) where I contribute to a suite of tools and interfaces to interact with a line of proprietary Natural Language Processing AI/ML SaaS products.
