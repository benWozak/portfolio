  My journey as a **Software Developer** started in 2016. I decided to leave my
  career in the culinary industry behind and pursue something more in-line with
  my values. I wanted to solve complex problems and utilize my skills
  meaningfully. This led me to discover a passion for front-end development at
  [The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology](https://www.sait.ca/).


  Iï»¿ was hired immediately out of graduation and have been working ever since. With now over five years of professional experience crafting user-interfaces for B2B SaaS product and high traffic client-facing websites, **I am specialized in all things JavaScript, creating elegant user experiences for complex software solutions** with a proven track record leading cross-functional teams in fast paced environments.
