  My journey as a **Software Developer** started in 2016. I decided to leave my
  career in the culinary industry behind and pursue something more in-line with
  my values. I wanted to solve complex problems and utilize my skills
  meaningfully. This led me to discover a passion for front-end development at
  [The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology](https://www.sait.ca/).


  Iï»¿ was hired immediately out of graduation and have been working ever since. Currently, I am employed at [chata.ai](https://chata.ai/), where I contribute to a suite of tools and interfaces to interact with a line of proprietary Natural Language Processing AI/ML SaaS products.
